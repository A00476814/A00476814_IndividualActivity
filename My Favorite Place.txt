One of best memories I have is of Manali. 
I visited Manali in February 2022 with my college friends. 
This was my first time visiting a place where it snows, and I was lucky enough to witness snowfall on our third day there.
Manali is full of cozy cafeâ€™s with delicious food; being a foodie, the place was like a paradise to me, offering good food and great views.
